    "# 4. Custom Model\n",
    "This guide will step through the process of implementing a custom model that can be used in NeuRec. It will show example code snippets that can help build a custom model, however, further development is needed to successfully complete the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of implementing a custom model involves two main steps: creating a model class; and, adding the model to NeuRec. The following sections discusses these two steps in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Model Class\n",
    "This step involves creating a class in the **model** folder. This class must extend the **AbstractRecommender** class, also in the model folder, and implement the required functions, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \\_\\_init\\_\\_()\n",
    "* build_graph()\n",
    "* train_model()\n",
    "* predict()\n",
    "\n",
    "> The class may have additional functions on top of these required functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the **properties** instance variable is required in the custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a shell custom model is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from neurec.model.AbstractRecommender import AbstractRecommender\n",
    "\n",
    "class Custom(AbstractRecommender):\n",
    "    properties = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, **kwds):\n",
    "        super().__init__(**kwds)\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def build_graph(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def train_model(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def predict(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential & Social Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Above shows how to implement a general recommender model, however, you may want to implement a sequential or social recommender model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequential model can be implemented like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from neurec.model.AbstractRecommender import SeqAbstractRecommender\n",
    "\n",
    "class Custom(SeqAbstractRecommender):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A social model can be implemented in a similar fashion:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from neurec.model.AbstractRecommender import SocialAbstractRecommender\n",
    "\n",
    "class Custom(SocialAbstractRecommender):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> These classes are child classes of AbstractRecommender and, therefore, implementation of the abstract methods in AbstractRecommender is still needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will discuss each of the requirements in turn, starting with the **properties** instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### properties\n",
    "This variable defines the list of properties that the model requires to run. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "properties = [\n",
    "    \"learning_rate\",\n",
    "    \"embedding_size\",\n",
    "    \"learner\",\n",
    "    \"topk\",\n",
    "    \"epochs\",\n",
    "    \"eps\",\n",
    "    \"adv\",\n",
    "    \"adver\",\n",
    "    \"adv_epoch\",\n",
    "    \"reg\",\n",
    "    \"reg_adv\",\n",
    "    \"batch_size\",\n",
    "    \"verbose\",\n",
    "    \"loss_function\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties will then be read from the properties file when the model is instantiated, by the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() function in the AbstractRecommender class, and made available in the variable **self.conf**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\_\\_init\\_\\_()\n",
    "This function can be used to initialise any settings that are required by the model. It must first call the parent \\_\\_init\\_\\_() function, which will load the properties, discussed above. Additionally, it will load the dataset into **self.dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from neurec.evaluation import Evaluate\n",
    "from neurec.model.AbstractRecommender import AbstractRecommender\n",
    "from neurec.util import reader, learner\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "        super().__init__(**kwds)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Load necessary settings from properties file\n",
    "        self.layers = self.conf[\"layers\"]\n",
    "        self.learning_rate = self.conf[\"learning_rate\"]\n",
    "        self.learner = self.conf[\"learner\"]\n",

    "        self.num_epochs= self.conf[\"epochs\"])\n",
    "        self.batch_size= self.conf[\"batch_size\"])\n",
    "        # etc...\n",
    "        \n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you need to log to the console, you can use the **self.logger** variable, further discussed [here](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/logging.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### build_graph()\n",
    "The build_graph() function is called by NeuRec before training the model and, therefore, can be used to create the network. Here, you can setup the loss and optimiser functions for the model, which can then be used while training the model:\n",
    "\n",

    "        \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### train_model()\n",
    "This function is called by NeuRec to train the model. You can use the data_gen module to generate the necessary data for training, which can be found in the **util** folder.
